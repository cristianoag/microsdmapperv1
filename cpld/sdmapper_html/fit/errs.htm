<tr><td>[Warning]:Cpld - Unable to retrieve the path to the iSE Project Repository. Will   use the default filename of 'sdmapper.ise'.INFO:Cpld - Inferring BUFG constraint for signal 'addr_bus_i&lt;4&gt;' based upon the   LOC constraint 'P27'. It is recommended that you declare this BUFG   explicitedly in your design. Note that for certain device families the output   of a BUFG constraint can not drive a gated clock, and the BUFG constraint   will be ignored.INFO:Cpld - Inferring BUFG constraint for signal 'clock_i' based upon the LOC   constraint 'P22'.

<tr><td>[Warning]:Cpld:1239 - The global clock designation (BUFG) on signal 'N13' is   ignored. Most likely the signal is gated and therefore cannot be used as a   global control signal.</td></tr>

<tr><td>[Warning]:Cpld:895 - Unable to map all desired signals into function block, FB1,   because too many function block inputs are required. Buffering output signal   data_bus_io&lt;2&gt; to allow all signals assigned to this function block to be   placed.</td></tr>
