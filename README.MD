# MSX microSD Mapper
The MSX microSD Mapper is a project aimed at building upon the success of Luciano Sturaro and Fabio Belavenuto's implementation of the well known MSX SD Mapper.

It features a microSD slot and simplified board design. 

With microSD cards becoming increasingly affordable and widely available, that seems to be a better option now. Additionally, the original SD Mapper v2 project had some confusion around the switches used to control the megaram/mapper, which were later changed in versions of the firmware to enable and disable the mapper on v2.
